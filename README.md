# Login-Registration-PHP-JavaScript
I have tried to implement a token authentication system for CURD operation in php. <br>
The idea is the same as Django-REST-framework. For updating, deleting, or reading the information, a certain token has to be provided.
#### 1. Token authentication
#### 2. Code verification
#### 3. Multiple file upload
#### 4. Drag and drop upload
